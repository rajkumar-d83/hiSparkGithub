/*
* A trait is like an interface with a partial implementation.
* In scala, trait is a collection of abstract and non-abstract methods.
* You can create trait that can have all abstract methods or some abstract and some non-abstract methods.
A variable that is declared either by using val or var keyword in a trait get internally implemented in
the class that implements the trait. Any variable which is declared by using val or var but not initialized is
considered abstract.*/

/*
You can also define method in trait as like in abstract class. I.e. you can treat trait as abstract class also.
In scala, trait is almost same as abstract class except that it can't have constructor.
You can't extend multiple abstract classes but can extend multiple traits.
